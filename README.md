# F.R.I.E.N.D.S-words2vec
A word2vec representation and analysis of the first 2 episodes of friends TV show
**Data** obtained from: http://www.livesinabox.com/friends/scripts.shtml 
Still not exactly accurate as it includes only the first two episodes but the results are pretty decent and understandable

Inspirated from siraj raval word2vec live tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY9EwZ02sXU&t=1784s

**To be done**: Include the rest of the episodes and analyze individual seasons to measure character development
